	<center><p><b>About Science and Humanities</b><p>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions whereas humanities is an academic discipline that helps build human attributes or qualities. Knowledge of Science eg. Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Mechanics etc. provide the basic background required to become an engineer. Humanities help build good knowledge of Philosophy, Sociology, History and communication languages. Both areas rely on accurate observation of materials and their phenomena. In the process of developing technology, engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming scientists for the moment.</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
	The profession of Engineering is more formally defined by American Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ABET), an organization that accredits college engineering programs as “Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component or process to meet desired needs. It is a decision making process in which the Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering Sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet these stated needs”. Within this definition, Science and Mathematics are described as an essential part of the entire engineering process. They do not act alone, in other words, they can’t stand alone. For addressing any issue relating to a project, an engineer should be able to analyze the nature and needs of the issue, then apply the knowledge of science to complete the engineering design and construction. Department of Science and Humanities at NCE The Department of Science and Humanities help students gain a better scientific perspective to their ideas. At NCE, this department is mainly responsible for first year academic program of all the faculties and handles the entire academic program of the students. The department looks over the applied engineering subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Probability and Statistics, Workshop Technology, Numerical Methods, Drawing, Thermodynamics, Communication English etc. as per the syllabus provided by the IOE. Students are taught through a practical approach to get an overview of what they are learning and have regular practical classes in the well-equipped laboratories. The department has been supporting other departments to help provide better education to produce efficient engineers in all faculties.</p>
	<p><b>Message from Science and Humanitites Department HOD: Mr. Madhu Krishna Shrestha</b></p>
	<p class="text-justify">Welcome to the Department of Science and Humanities at National College of Engineering. It gives me pride and pleasure to introduce the Department of science and Humanities, which is focused on devising innovative research , correct solutions to hard problems, enhance the educational experience for our students , expand our infrastructure , and allow us to launch new and exciting initiatives in teaching research across many fields and independent thinking to produce new knowledge.</p>
	<p class="text-justify">	The diverse research interests of our faculty are reflected directly in our educational programs as the department of Science and Humanities has been a vital component of the Faculty of Engineering.
	We believe that understanding is the first step to being able to solve the problems and educating our students to conceptualize and express ideas analytically and creatively and to reason critically. Thanks to the efforts of our researchers and teachers and our students too, we continue to play a leading role in our discipline, both nationally and internationally.</p>
