<p class="text-justify">
Civil engineering is arguably the enormous engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like buildings, roads, highways, hydropower, bridges, canals, dams etc. These built environment encompasses much of what defines modern civilization. Civil engineers build the world’s huge infrastructure. In doing so,
they have shaped the histories and destines of every nation. In fact, civil engineer’s concepts make civilization truly possible.
Since time immemorial, human beings have been engaged in building all kinds of edifices. From huts made of mud to high raise buildings, we have definitely come a long way. As civilizations matured, it simultaneously led to the development of bigger, better and diverse structures.
Some significant structures from the past include the Bruz Tower of Dubai, the tallest building in the world, Bird-nest stadium of China, Stonehenge in Britain, the Great Wall of China and Huge marine dams of Holland, the magnificent Eiffel tower of Paris etc. These are just but a mere glimpse of the examples set by one of the important branches of engineering, that is, Civil Engineering.
