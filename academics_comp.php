<center><p><b>About Computer Engineering!</b></p>
<p class="text-justify">
Computer engineers work on components, devices, programs, algorithms and systems that are used in computers, and on techniques of computation, analysis and implementation that are applicable to single computers or to systems of computers.
In the past, work in this area used to be compartmentalized between hardware and software, but the boundaries between these two categories have become less distinct. Many computer engineers (and electronics engineers) are well versed in both hardware and software, and provide “hybrid” solutions on a regular basis.
Due to the wide use of computers across industries and applications, we find computer engineers in many diverse areas. For example, computer engineers design application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for use in cellular phones; they devise and program field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for control systems in manufacturing plants and power stations; they develop microprocessors for personal computers; they introduce embedded systems into diverse applications such as digital watches, portable music players, traffic control systems, and systems that control nuclear power plants.
Computer Engineering
Many computer engineers work on the design of very large systems that integrate many components and many computers. One example is computational grids, which harvest the resources of hundreds, even thousands of computers for performing intensive computations that are beyond the capability of a single computer. Another example is data grids which allow sharing and management of large amounts of distributed data (such as health information of patients in a country by hospitals, or meteorological and other environmental information collected by thousands of sensors in the ocean). Many computer engineers are involved with communication networks that connect multiple computers, sensors, actuators, and special-purpose devices.
Computer engineering thus provides society with many critical utilities. Computers and computer engineers have impact on public welfare and safety, as well as on health and healthcare, the environment, quality of life, transportation, the food supply, computing, and leisure.

<p  ><b>Message from Electronics and Computer Department HOD: Pradip Adhikaree</b></p>
<p class="text-justify">The Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering is established from the very first academic year of National College of Engineering. The department has been imparting high quality education to the young budding engineers with the support of excellent infrastructures, well-equipped laboratories and valuable resources. A team of dedicated, highly qualified and experienced faculty members is always keen to share their knowledge and expertise with the students. The departmental faculty, supporting staff and students work as a family in all departmental activities.
For the students to enhance their practical knowledge, minor and major projects are implemented in the curriculum. The department also arranges various value-added courses for the students according to the trending global markets. Besides, the department also conducts regular seminars, workshops and lectures by eminent experts from various renowned organizations. The students are encouraged to organize and participate in various local and national level technical events through Robotics Club and IT Club. The department strives to provide its students with excellent academic as well as technical opportunities that serve as the foundation for their professional growth.</p>
